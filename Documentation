The game runs in the terminal and uses non-blocking stdin for controls.

## Controls

- `W` / `w` — move up
- `S` / `s` — move down
- `A` / `a` — move left
- `D` / `d` — move right
- `Space` — shoot
- `Q` / `q` — quit

Note: The in-game screen mentions `Enter` and `Esc`, but the current input handler recognizes `Space` for shooting and `Q` for quitting.

## Windows: `'stty' is not recognized...'` message

On Windows the `stty` utility is not available. The script detects Windows and:

- Attempts to enable VT100 (ANSI) using `sapi_windows_vt100_support`
- Skips `stty` calls (no error affects game execution)

If you see `'stty' is not recognized as an internal or external command...'` from other tools, it is unrelated to the script; run the game with `php shooter.php` in an ANSI-capable terminal (Windows Terminal / newer PowerShell / ConEmu).

## Code structure

- `Entity`, `Spaceship`, `Enemy`, `Bullet` — base classes for actors
- `Scene` — game state, rendering, movement, collisions, spawning
- Terminal helpers: enable/disable raw mode and shutdown restore logic
- Main loop at the bottom of `shooter.php` — reads input, updates, renders

## Known issues / TODO

- On Windows `pcntl_signal` is not available; graceful Ctrl+C handling may be limited.
- UI message mentions `Enter`/`Esc` which are not implemented in the input handler.
- Consider debouncing shooting or adding continuous-fire options.
- Add unit tests and configuration options (speed, enemy count).
